                <p>&ensp; Welcome to my website! My name is Natalee Sama and I'm a senior Computer Science student at Florida State University.
                    I grew up in South Florida in a family of four with a small Shih Tzu, Pumpkin, and recent addition, a black cat named Mazzy.
                    I love anything creative: painting, music, movies, knitting, reading, etc; and that is normally how I like to spend my free time.
                    This will be my seventh year of programming! Throughout the years I have learned a variety of different languages, techniques,
                    and styles. As a 15 year old, Python was the perfect introduction to coding, saying hello to the world of programming 
                    (literally - I've lost count of how many programs have contained "Hello World"). I then continued my high school education
                    with Java, Html, CSS, and JavaScript. I decided to stick with Computer Science in college, gaining lots of knowledge on
                    C++, C, MIPS, SQL, and a deeper view of my previous languages. Florida State also taught me lots about OOP, computer hardware,
                    Calculus, Discrete Math, and more. I am thankful for the variety of classes offered at FSU, as my educational exploration has 
                    allowed me to find a special love for both the front-end and back-end sides of web development. I hope to persue this passion
                    in a professional setting once my education is complete.
                </p>

                <h1 class = "mainH">Why Computer Science?</h1>
                <p>&ensp; I was raised by two incredibly smart STEM lovers. With a math-teaching mother and a medical-expert father, I was fortunate to always
                    have my own personal tutors at home. Due to this, I developed a love for math and always tried to push myself with the next hardest
                    course. Prior to my CS introduction, my middle school Computer Lab teacher sent me to represent our school at a local education festival. 
                    There, I learned the building blocks of coding before I even understood what a program was. During my freshman year of high school, 
                    my math teacher noticed my interest and recommended a Python elective to see if my math enthusiasm translated to CS, and 
                    it did tenfold. Through the support of an amazing CS teacher, I slowly grew a love for programming and all the facets that make
                    up Computer Science.
